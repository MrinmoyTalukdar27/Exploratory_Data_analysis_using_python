Hi everyone,

This is my first data analysis project, where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to understand why customers are churning from a telecom company’s services.

I explored various factors such as contract type, tenure, payment methods, and additional services to find out what drives customer churn. The analysis includes several bar and pie charts for better visualization and insights.

It was a great learning experience working with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and I’m really excited to share this project with you all.

I’d love to hear your feedback or suggestions on how I can improve it further.

Thanks for checking it out!
